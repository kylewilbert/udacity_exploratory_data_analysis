# udacity_exploratory_data_analysis

## Introduction
I completed this project toward completion of my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. This is a basic exploratory data analysis using R. The structure is Univariate Plots & Analysis, Bivariate Plots & Analysis, Multivariate Plots & Analysis, and finally Reflection.

## Dataset
Udacity provided the dataset. It is too large to share the csv. Also, not sure I am allowed to share it publicly as Udacity provided it, but Prosper does have an API that allows you to request data (https://prosper.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210013083-Where-can-I-download-Prosper-loan-data-)

### Loan Data from Prosper (Last updated 03/11/2014)
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information.
