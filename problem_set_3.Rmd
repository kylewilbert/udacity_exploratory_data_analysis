This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Quiz: Price Histograms with Facet and Color

# Create a histogram of diamond prices.
# Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars.

# The plot should look something like this.

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type
# 'qual' was used to color the histogram using
# scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# Quiz: Price vs Volume and Diamond Clarity

# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.
# volume (x * y * z) and color the points by
# the clarity of diamonds. Use scale on the y-axis
# to take the log10 of price. You should also
# omit the top 1% of diamond volumes from the plot.

# Note: Volume is a very rough approximation of
# a diamond's actual volume.

# The plot should look something like this.

#Quiz: Proportion of Friends Initiated
# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

# This programming assignment WILL BE automatically graded.

```{r}
# Quiz: prop_initiated vs. tenure

# Create a line graph of the median proportion of
# friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs.
# tenure and color the line segment by
# year_joined.bucket.

# Recall, we created year_joined.bucket in Lesson 5
# by first creating year_joined from the variable tenure.
# Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create
# four bins or cohorts of users.

# (2004, 2009]
# (2009, 2011]
# (2011, 2012]
# (2012, 2014]

# The plot should look something like this.

# Smooth the last plot you created of
# of prop_initiated vs tenure colored by
# year_joined.bucket. You can bin together ranges
# of tenure or add a smoother to the plot.
